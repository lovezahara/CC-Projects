Hi there! Thanks for playing a REZ game!
This game is a recreation and expansion of the beloved game Flappy Bird
Before you begin playing, there are a few things you need to download and know

Downloads:
For creating this game, we had to download PyGame:

Mac - simply type into your terminal: pip3 install pygame 
Windows - simply type into your terminal: pip install pygame

HOW TO PLAY:

1. Press space bar to move the bird up, you will naturally fall down
2. Avoid touching the pipes, see how long you can last going in between them
3. Also avoid flying out of the window as hitting the sky and ground will kill you

MODES:
There are three different game modes to this game
1. Classic: In this mode, you simply avoid the pipes. Nothing else to it!
2. Speed: In this mode, the pipes begin to generate more often the more you play! 
Can be challenging and even become impossible depending on the heights the pipes generate at.
3. Coins: In this mode, you collect coins to increase your overall score! The pipes generate
less often and move slower to allow players to collect more coins.

THE DIFFERENT SCREENS:
1. The game begins on, what we call, a user screen. This is where the user is required to enter
their player username. NO EMPTY NAMES ALLOWED or it will yell at you for two seconds then prompt
you to enter a name again.
2. After you enter a name and click submit, you will be taken to our Mode screen. Here you can 
pick what game modes you want to play as well as view the leaderboard. 
3. Once you click which mode you want, you will be transported to the screen that carries out the 
game mode.
4. After you die in the game, you will see a screen that gives you two options. The first is to
try again. This brings you back to the Mode screen where you can either pick the same mode or 
another. The second option allows you to exit the game. This will bring you to the leaderboard
where you can then fully exit the game.
5. The last screen is the leaderboard which you can access from the Mode screen or you can view it
if you click "exit game" on the death screen before you fully leave the game. This screen shows the 
top 3 players in each game mode.

Happy Flapping!
